    <string name="sample_movie_description">The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of
        an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,[N
        2] a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which
        he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his
        lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where
        physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent
        Phil Coulson explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The
        Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes
        the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including Clint
        Barton, to aid him in his getaway.</string>
